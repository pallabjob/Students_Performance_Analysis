# Students_Performance_Analysis
Project Overview

This project analyzed students’ Exam Scores, Previous Scores, Study Hours, Attendance, Physical Activity, and Sleep Hours. The data also covered dimensions like Parental Education, Internet Access by Income Level, Peer Influence on Motivation, and School Type (Public vs. Private).

Key Insights

Gender-Wise Analysis:
Males make up 58% of exam scores, while females contribute 42%.
Gender also plays a role in access to resources, with more males having higher access levels.
Parental Education Impact:
Students with parents educated to the college level have significantly higher exam scores, compared to those whose parents have only completed high school or postgraduate studies.
Resource and Income Analysis:
Medium-income families have the highest internet access, showing that internet availability is crucial for academic performance.
Teacher quality in public schools is higher in terms of student count, but private schools also provide significant support.
Motivation & Peer Influence:
Peer influence is a crucial factor, with a nearly equal distribution between positive and neutral motivation levels. However, a negative influence impacts around 1.4K students.
Activity & Sleep Insights:
There’s a direct link between physical activity and gender, with males being more active. Sleep hours also vary based on school type, possibly impacting performance.
Tutoring Sessions and Exam Scores:
Students with more tutoring sessions show higher scores, emphasizing the importance of additional academic support.
Learning Disabilities:
Out of 13.2K students, around 50% have learning disabilities, highlighting a need for more tailored support in educational institutions.

Conclusion:

This project emphasizes the need for personalized learning environments, resource accessibility, and motivational support to improve student performance. Factors such as parental education, internet access, and school infrastructure play a critical role in shaping students’ academic journeys.
